//! Fire-time GitHub issue-dispatch flow (PRD #120, M2.1–M2.4 + M3.2 + M1.3).
//!
//! This is the impure, daemon-side counterpart to the pure helpers in
//! [`crate::issue_dispatch`]. On each fire of an `issue_dispatch` scheduled task
//! the daemon composes those helpers with #127's spawn primitive
//! ([`crate::spawn::spawn`]) and the `gh` / `git` binaries on `PATH`:
//!
//!   1. **M2.1** — provision the repo clone under the task's `working_dir`:
//!      clone-if-missing (`gh repo clone`) / fetch + fast-forward-pull-if-present
//!      (`git -C <clone> fetch` then `git -C <clone> pull --ff-only`). An existing
//!      clone is verified to be the right repo by its `origin` before being
//!      touched (L3, fail-closed), and a refresh failure on it is non-fatal —
//!      the run continues with the refs already on disk (S3).
//!   2. enumerate the repo's open issues (`gh issue list`), capping at
//!      `max_per_run` **in code** on the returned order — the issue list may
//!      ignore `--limit`.
//!   3. **M2.2** — for each issue, decide dispatch-vs-skip from the two
//!      idempotency signals (per-issue worktree already on disk; an open PR whose
//!      head is `agent/issue-<n>`) via [`crate::issue_dispatch::dispatch_decision`].
//!   4. **M2.2 / M2.3** — on dispatch, create the per-issue worktree on
//!      `agent/issue-<n>` (creating the branch with `-b`, or attaching a branch
//!      left behind by an earlier closed-without-PR run — B1) and [`spawn`] one
//!      agent into it, delivering the substituted prompt. The spawn primitive
//!      already branches on the worktree's `.dot-agent-deck.toml` (orchestration
//!      tab vs single-agent card) — reused, not duplicated.
//!   5. **M2.4** — record each spawned pane → worktree in a daemon-side
//!      [`WorktreeRegistry`] so closing the tab later removes the worktree (while
//!      PRESERVING the clone). See [`record_worktree`] / [`take_worktree`] /
//!      [`remove_worktree`].
//!   6. **M3.2** — every issue runs inside its own error boundary: a failing
//!      issue (clone/worktree/`gh` error — e.g. the test stub's simulated
//!      `pr list` failure) is surfaced through the notifier and the run CONTINUES
//!      with the remaining issues. One issue never aborts the rest.
//!   7. **M1.3** — per-issue success / skip / failure events are surfaced through
//!      #127's existing [`Notifier`] seam (no parallel notification system).
//!
//! All GitHub/git access goes through the `gh` / `git` binaries resolved from
//! `PATH`, inheriting the daemon's environment — that is exactly what lets the
//! L2 tests isolate everything offline behind a stub `gh` on `PATH` plus a local
//! fixture remote.
