#![cfg(feature = "e2e")]

//! L2 end-to-end hook-delivery tests. Each function spawns the real
//! `dot-agent-deck` binary inside an isolated PTY, writes a hook
//! payload to the per-test hook socket, and asserts on the rendered
//! grid through a `vt100` parser. PRD #77 Decision 2 + Decision 6.
//!
//! Decision 6: this file is gated behind the `e2e` feature so CI
//! (which runs only `cargo test-fast`) never compiles it.

/// directly to the per-test hook socket. The deck's daemon auto-
/// registers the unknown pane on its first `SessionStart` event,
/// so a card titled `m2demo` should appear on the dashboard within
