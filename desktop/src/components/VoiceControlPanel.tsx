/**
 * PRD #802 M6 — the voice surface: one button, and what it reports.
 *
 * The pipeline is capture → segment → transcribe → resolve → validate →
 * execute → report, and then round again without another press. Rust owns the
 * middle ({@link ../lib/bridge!DeckBridge.resolveVoice} and the three
 * microphone verbs beside it); this file owns the two ends — the button an
 * utterance starts at, and the sentence it finishes as.
 *
 * # Voice ONLY, which is a withdrawal rather than an omission
 *
 * An earlier build of this file opened a dialog with a text box and a *Run
 * command* button, and offered the microphone only once transcription was
 * configured. The typed path was not asked for; it was a build-time decision,
 * and the product owner withdrew it: *"Only voice. When I click the Voice
 * button, it should activate voice control and it should keep being controlled
 * by voice until the button is clicked again."*
 *
 * So there is no text box, no dialog, and no separate *start listening*
 * control. **The button is the control.** Press it and voice control is on
 * until it is pressed again; the utterances in between are segmented by
 * voice-activity detection in `voice::capture`, not by a second press.
 *
 * What the typed path used to buy was coverage for everybody with no
 * transcription credential, and that argument does not survive its own premise:
 * a path nobody speaks through proves the resolver and never the surface. The
 * browser fixture replaces it properly — it simulates a microphone the same way
 * it simulates a daemon, so the whole loop is driven in Playwright with no
 * credential anywhere near it.
 *
 * # It renders sentences; it never composes one
 *
 * Every situation an utterance can end in arrives carrying its own `sentence`,
 * rendered Rust-side from the command table. So this file reads `outcome.kind`
 * for exactly one decision — whether to dispatch — and prints `outcome.sentence`
 * for everything else. It never builds wording from `action`, `param`, `matches`
 * or `detail`, because a surface that could phrase a situation is a surface that
 * can phrase it differently from the one beside it, and the table would stop
 * being the single answer to what the app says.
 *
 * The sentences written here are {@link NOTHING_DISPATCHED},
 * {@link SCREEN_MOVED_ON}, {@link VOICE_UNAVAILABLE} and
 * {@link VOICE_CAP_DISCARDED}. The first two are for situations Rust
 * structurally cannot know about; the last two are about the surface's own
 * state machine rather than about an utterance. See their own notes.
 *
 * # Voice gets no execution path of its own
 *
 * Nothing here navigates. A dispatch is handed to the host's `onDispatch`, which
 * runs it through `dispatchVoiceAction` — the same registry entry the rail button
 * and the palette item run through. The host owns it rather than this file
 * because running the command and knowing how to undo it are the same question,
 * and only the host knows which screen the user was on.
 *
 * # Where this is mounted, and why it matters
 *
 * Above the deck/overview screen switch, in {@link ../App!DeckShell} — which is
 * architectural rather than cosmetic. The report describes a navigation that has
 * just happened and the Undo beside it reverses one, so both have to outlive the
 * screen change they are about. Mounted inside either screen, a successful
 * `open_overview` would unmount the surface that was explaining it.

              Each sentence is its own element holding nothing else, so the
              transcript inside it survives to the DOM exactly as Rust rendered
              it — punctuation, casing, inner quotes and all. Seeing what was
              heard is what turns a mis-transcription into a correction the user
              can make.

              `displayText` is the render seam every free-form string in this app
              crosses: a sentence embeds a transcript, and a transcript is
              model- or microphone-supplied text with control and bidi codepoints
              still in it. It sanitises and bounds; it never rewords.

              The `message` budget, 240 characters, is the one written for "the
              daemon's own connection message" — one sentence, once per screen,
              which is this shape exactly. It is a real bound rather than a
              formality: thirty seconds of speech is around 700 characters, so a
              rambling utterance's no-match sentence IS elided here, with the
              clamp's own marker so it never passes itself off as complete.
